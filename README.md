üëã Welcome to **Matchstick** - a unit testing framework for The Graph protocol. Try out your mapping logic in a sandboxed environment and ensure your handlers run correctly when deploying your awesome subgraph!

## Quick Start üöÄ
The release binary comes in three flavours - for **macOS**, **Linux** and **Windows**. To add **Matchstick** to your subgraph project just open up a terminal, navigate to the root folder of your project and simply follow these steps:

‚ùó As of version 0.2.0, you no longer need to write the `runTests` function, just `test` blocks. <br>
‚ùó As of version 0.2.0, tests' directory structure has changed. Please refer to [Conventions](#Conventions) for more details.

‚ùó If you don't have Postgres installed, you will need to install it. <br>
As of version 0.1.3 Matchstick is updating API version from 0.0.4 to 0.0.5
‚ùó Subgraphs with API version 0.0.4 mappings won't work with Matchstick version 0.1.3+ <br>
As of version 0.22.0 of graph-cli the `graph test` command has been changed - now it downloads the latest Matchstick binary and runs the tests of the given datasource and is now the only thing you need to run to use Matchstick! - example usage: `graph test Gravity`
‚ùó The next section (up to Install dependencies) is completely unnecessary (expect installing postgres) if you are using version 0.22.0+ of graph-cli.

### macOS Ô£ø

‚ùó Postgres installation command:
```
brew install postgresql
```

If you are using macOS 11/Big Sur
```
curl -OL https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.2.0/binary-macos-11 &&
mv binary-macos-11 matchstick &&
chmod a+x matchstick
```

If you are using macOS 10.15/Catalina
```
curl -OL https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.2.0/binary-macos-10.15 &&
mv binary-macos-10.15 matchstick &&
chmod a+x matchstick
```

If you are using macOS 10.14/Mojave
```
curl -OL https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.2.0/binary-macos-10.14 &&
mv binary-macos-10.14 matchstick &&
chmod a+x matchstick
```

### Linux üêß

‚ùó Postgres installation command (depends on your distro):
```
sudo apt install postgresql
```

If you are using Ubuntu 20.04/Focal Fossa
```
curl -OL https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.2.0/binary-linux-20 &&
mv binary-linux-20 matchstick &&
chmod a+x matchstick
```

If you are using Ubuntu 18.04/Bionic Beaver
```
curl -OL https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.2.0/binary-linux-18 &&
mv binary-linux-18 matchstick &&
chmod a+x matchstick
```

### Windows

‚ùó Postgres installation command:
```
choco install postgresql12
```

```
curl -OL https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.2.0/binary-windows &&
move binary-windows matchstick
```

### Install dependencies
In order to use the test helper methods and run the tests, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
yarn add matchstick-as
```

### Run
Just run the following in the root folder of your project:

`./matchstick <ONE-OR-MORE-TEST-NAMES>`

For instance, in our [demo-subgraph example](https://github.com/LimeChain/demo-subgraph "demo-subgraph"), the command looks like this:

`./matchstick gravity`

**Tip:** You can run all tests at once by simply invoking:
`./matchstick`

Now you can jump straight to the [test examples](https://github.com/LimeChain/demo-subgraph/blob/main/tests "examples of tests") in our [demo-subgraph](https://github.com/LimeChain/demo-subgraph "demo-subgraph") and start your journey in Subgraph unit testing!

## Conventions

### Directory structure

For **Matchstick** to recognize your tests, you need to put them in a `tests/` folder in the root of your project.

### Naming

Your test file should start with a name of your chosing (for example the name of the tested data source) and end with `.test.ts`.
For instance:
```
tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gravity.test.ts

1 file
```

---

You can also group related tests and other files into folders.
For example:
```
tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gravity
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gravity.test.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.ts

1 directory, 2 files
```

Now, under the `gravity` folder, all files ending with `.test.ts` are interpreted as a single test with the name `gravity` (the name of the folder).

### Caveats

 - **Matchstick** is case-insensitive regarding data sources names. Meaning, *Gravity = gravity = gRaVitY*.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites
To build and run **Matchstick** you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Rust - [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html "How to install Rust")
- PostgreSQL ‚Äì [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Setup
Clone this repository and run `cargo build`. If that executes successfully congratulations üéâ you're all set.

**NOTE:** *You may encounter an error, related to missing `libpq` dependencies on your system. In that case - install the missing dependencies (listed in the error log) with your package manager.*

## Example Usage üìñ

If you prefer learning through watching, here's a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-orbT4gRiA)!

Let's explore a few common scenarios where we'd want to test our handler functions. We've created a [**demo-subgraph repo**](https://github.com/LimeChain/demo-subgraph "demo-subgraph") to fully demonstrate how to use the framework and all its functionality. For the full examples, feel free to check it out in depth. Let's dive in! We've got the following simple **generated** event:
```typescript
export class NewGravatar extends ethereum.Event {
  get params(): NewGravatar__Params {
    return new NewGravatar__Params(this);
  }
}

export class NewGravatar__Params {
  _event: NewGravatar;

  constructor(event: NewGravatar) {
    this._event = event;
  }

  get id(): BigInt {
    return this._event.parameters[0].value.toBigInt();
  }

  get owner(): Address {
    return this._event.parameters[1].value.toAddress();
  }

  get displayName(): string {
    return this._event.parameters[2].value.toString();
  }

  get imageUrl(): string {
    return this._event.parameters[3].value.toString();
  }
}
```

Along with the following simple **generated** entity:
```typescript
export class Gravatar extends Entity {
  constructor(id: string) {
    super();
    this.set("id", Value.fromString(id));
  }

  save(): void {
    let id = this.get("id");
    assert(id !== null, "Cannot save Gravatar entity without an ID");
    assert(
      id.kind == ValueKind.STRING,
      "Cannot save Gravatar entity with non-string ID. " +
        'Considering using .toHex() to convert the "id" to a string.'
    );
    store.set("Gravatar", id.toString(), this);
  }

  static load(id: string): Gravatar | null {
    return store.get("Gravatar", id) as Gravatar | null;
  }

  get id(): string {
    let value = this.get("id");
    return value.toString();
  }

  set id(value: string) {
    this.set("id", Value.fromString(value));
  }

  get owner(): Bytes {
    let value = this.get("owner");
    return value.toBytes();
  }

  set owner(value: Bytes) {
    this.set("owner", Value.fromBytes(value));
  }

  get displayName(): string {
    let value = this.get("displayName");
    return value.toString();
  }

  set displayName(value: string) {
    this.set("displayName", Value.fromString(value));
  }

  get imageUrl(): string {
    let value = this.get("imageUrl");
    return value.toString();
  }

  set imageUrl(value: string) {
    this.set("imageUrl", Value.fromString(value));
  }
}
```

And finally, we have a handler function (**that we've written in our** `gravity.ts` **file**) that deals with the events. As well as two little helper functions - one for multiple events of the same type and another for creating a filled instance of ethereum.Event - `newMockEvent` (Although `changetype` is inherently unsafe, most events can be safely upcast to the desired ethereum.Event extending class as shown in the example below):
```typescript
export function handleNewGravatar(event: NewGravatar): void {
  let gravatar = new Gravatar(event.params.id.toHex())
  gravatar.owner = event.params.owner
  gravatar.displayName = event.params.displayName
  gravatar.imageUrl = event.params.imageUrl
  gravatar.save()
}

export function handleNewGravatars(events: NewGravatar[]): void {
  events.forEach(event => {
    handleNewGravatar(event);
  });
}

export function createNewGravatarEvent(id: i32, ownerAddress: string, displayName: string, imageUrl: string): NewGravatar {
  let newGravatarEvent = changetype<NewGravatar>(newMockEvent()) 
  newGravatarEvent.parameters = new Array();
  let idParam = new ethereum.EventParam("id", ethereum.Value.fromI32(id));
  let addressParam = new ethereum.EventParam("ownderAddress", ethereum.Value.fromAddress(Address.fromString(ownerAddress)));
  let displayNameParam = new ethereum.EventParam("displayName", ethereum.Value.fromString(displayName));
  let imageUrlParam = new ethereum.EventParam("imageUrl", ethereum.Value.fromString(imageUrl));

  newGravatarEvent.parameters.push(idParam);
  newGravatarEvent.parameters.push(addressParam);
  newGravatarEvent.parameters.push(displayNameParam);
  newGravatarEvent.parameters.push(imageUrlParam);

  return newGravatarEvent;
}
```
That's all well and good, but what if we had more complex logic in the handler function? We would want to check that the event that gets saved in the store looks the way we want it to look like.

What we need to do is create a test file in the `tests/` subdirectory under the root folder. We can name it however we want as long as it ends with `.test.ts` - let's say `gravity.test.ts`. 

**Tip:** You can also group test files into directories, for example:
```bash
tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gravity
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foo.test.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bar.test.ts
```
Now, your test name would be `gravity` - the name of the directory.

```typescript
import { clearStore, test, assert } from "matchstick-as/assembly/index";
import { Gravatar } from "../../generated/schema";
import { NewGravatar } from "../../generated/Gravity/Gravity";
import { createNewGravatarEvent, handleNewGravatars } from "../mappings/gravity";

test("Can call mappings with custom events", () => {
  // Initialise
  let gravatar = new Gravatar("gravatarId0");
  gravatar.save();

  // Call mappings
  let newGravatarEvent = createNewGravatarEvent(
      12345,
      "0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7",
      "cap",
      "pac",
  );

  let anotherGravatarEvent = createNewGravatarEvent(
      3546,
      "0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7",
      "cap",
      "pac",
  );

  handleNewGravatars([newGravatarEvent, anotherGravatarEvent]);

  assert.fieldEquals(
      GRAVATAR_ENTITY_TYPE,
      "gravatarId0",
      "id",
      "gravatarId0",
  );
  assert.fieldEquals(GRAVATAR_ENTITY_TYPE, "12345", "id", "12345");
  assert.fieldEquals(GRAVATAR_ENTITY_TYPE, "3546", "id", "3546");
  clearStore();
});

test("Next test", () => {
  //...
});

```

That's a lot to unpack! First off, an important thing to notice is that we're importing things from `matchstick-as`, that's our AssemblyScript helper library (distributed as an npm module), which you can check out [here](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick-as "here"). It provides us with useful testing methods and also defines the `test()` function which we will use to build our test blocks. The rest of it is pretty straightforward - here's what happens:
- We're setting up our initial state and adding one custom Gravatar entity;
- We define two `NewGravatar` event objects along with their data, using the `createNewGravatarEvent()` function;
- We're calling out handler methods for those events - `handleNewGravatars()` and passing in the list of our custom events;
- We assert the state of the store. How does that work? - We're passing a unique combination of Entity type and id. Then we check a specific field on that Entity and assert that it has the value we expect it to have. We're doing this both for the initial burger Entity we added and for the one that gets added when the handler function is called;
- And lastly - we're cleaning the store using `clearStore()` so that our next test can start with a fresh and empty store object. We can define as many test blocks as we want.

There we go - we've tested our first event handler! üëè

Now let's recap and take a look at some concise, common **use cases**, which include what we already covered plus more useful things we can use **Matchstick** for.

## Use Cases üß∞
### Hydrating the store with a certain state
Users are able to hydrate the store with a known set of entities. Here's an example to initialise the store with a Gravatar entity:
```typescript
let gravatar = new Gravatar("entryId");
gravatar.save();
```

### Calling a mapping function with an event
A user can create a custom event and pass it to a mapping function that is bound to the store:
```typescript
import { store } from "matchstick-as/assembly/store";
import { NewGravatar } from "../../generated/Gravity/Gravity";
import { handleNewGravatars, createNewGravatarEvent } from "./mapping";

let newGravatarEvent = createNewGravatarEvent(12345, "0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7", "cap", "pac");

handleNewGravatar(newGravatarEvent);
```

### Calling all of the mappings with event fixtures
Users can call the mappings with test fixtures.
```typescript
import { NewGravatar } from "../../generated/Gravity/Gravity";
import { store } from "matchstick-as/assembly/store";
import { handleNewGravatars, createNewGravatarEvent } from "./mapping";

let newGravatarEvent = createNewGravatarEvent(12345, "0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7", "cap", "pac");

let anotherGravatarEvent = createNewGravatarEvent(3546, "0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7", "cap", "pac");

handleNewGravatars([newGravatarEvent, anotherGravatarEvent]);
```

### Mocking contract calls
Users can mock contract calls:
```typescript
import { addMetadata, assert, createMockedFunction, clearStore, test } from "matchstick-as/assembly/index";
import { Gravity } from "../../generated/Gravity/Gravity";
import { Address, BigInt, ethereum } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";

let contractAddress = Address.fromString("0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7");
let expectedResult = Address.fromString("0x90cBa2Bbb19ecc291A12066Fd8329D65FA1f1947");
let bigIntParam = BigInt.fromString("1234");
createMockedFunction(contractAddress, "gravatarToOwner", "gravatarToOwner(uint256):(address)")
    .withArgs([ethereum.Value.fromSignedBigInt(bigIntParam)])
    .returns([ethereum.Value.fromAddress(Address.fromString("0x90cBa2Bbb19ecc291A12066Fd8329D65FA1f1947"))]);

let gravity = Gravity.bind(contractAddress);
let result = gravity.gravatarToOwner(bigIntParam);

assert.equals(ethereum.Value.fromAddress(expectedResult), ethereum.Value.fromAddress(result));
```
As demonstrated, in order to mock a contract call and hardcore a return value, the user must provide a contract address, function name, function signature, an array of arguments, and of course - the return value.

Users can also mock function reverts:
```typescript
let contractAddress = Address.fromString("0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7");
createMockedFunction(contractAddress, "getGravatar", "getGravatar(address):(string,string)")
    .withArgs([ethereum.Value.fromAddress(contractAddress)])
    .reverts();
```

### Asserting the state of the store
Users are able to assert the final (or midway) state of the store through asserting entities. In order to do this, the user has to supply an Entity type, the specific ID of an Entity, a name of a field on that Entity, and the expected value of the field. Here's a quick example:
```typescript
import { assert } from "matchstick-as/assembly/index";
import { Gravatar } from "../generated/schema";

let gravatar = new Gravatar("gravatarId0");
gravatar.save();

assert.fieldEquals("Gravatar", "gravatarId0", "id", "gravatarId0");

```
Running the assert.fieldEquals() function will check for equality of the given field against the given expected value. The test will fail and an error message will be outputted if the values are **NOT** equal. Otherwise the test will pass successfully.

### Interacting with Event metadata
Users can use default transaction metadata, which could be returned as an ethereum.Event by using the `newMockEvent()` function. The following example shows how you can read/write to those fields on the Event object:

```typescript
let logType = newGravatarEvent.logType;

let UPDATED_ADDRESS = "0xB16081F360e3847006dB660bae1c6d1b2e17eC2A";
newGravatarEvent.address = Address.fromString(UPDATED_ADDRESS);
```

### Asserting variable equality
```typescript
assert.equals(ethereum.Value.fromString("hello"); ethereum.Value.fromString("hello"));

// String
assert.stringEquals(DEFAULT_LOG_TYPE, newGravatarEvent.logType!);

// Address
assert.addressEquals(Address.fromString(DEFAULT_ADDRESS), newGravatarEvent.address);
 
// BigInt
assert.bigIntEquals(BigInt.fromI32(DEFAULT_LOG_INDEX), newGravatarEvent.logIndex);

// Bytes & nested objects
assert.bytesEquals((Bytes.fromHexString(DEFAULT_BLOCK_HASH) as Bytes), newGravatarEvent.block.hash);
```

### Asserting that an Entity is **not** in the store
Users can assert that an entity does not exist in the store. If the entity is in fact in the store, the test will fail with a relevant error message. Here's a quick example of how to use this functionality:

```typescript
assert.notInStore("Gravatar", "23");
```

### Printing the whole store (for debug purposes)
You can print the whole store to the console using this helper function:
```typescript
import { logStore } from "matchstick-as/assembly/store";

logStore();
```

### Expected failure
Users can have expected test failures, using the `shouldFail` flag on the `test()` functions:
```typescript
test("Should throw an error", () => {
  throw new Error();
}, true);
```

If the test is marked with `shouldFail = true` but **DOES NOT** fail, that will show up as an error in the logs and the test block will fail. Also, if it's marked with `shouldFail = false` (the default state), the test executor will crash.

### Logging
Having custom logs in the unit tests is exactly the same as logging in the mappings. The difference is that the log object needs to be imported from `matchstick-as` rather than `graph-ts`. Here's a simple example with all non-critical log types:
```typescript
import { test } from "matchstick-as/assembly/index";
import { log } from "matchstick-as/assembly/log";

test("Success", () => {
    log.success("Success!". []);
});
test("Error", () => {
    log.error("Error :( ", []);
});
test("Debug", () => {
    log.debug("Debugging...", []);
});
test("Info", () => {
    log.info("Info!", []);
});
test("Warning", () => {
    log.warning("Warning!", []);
});
```

Users can also simulate a critical failure, like so:
```typescript
test("Blow everything up", () => {
    log.critical("Boom!");
});
```

Logging critical errors will stop the execution of the tests and blow everything up. After all - we want to make sure you're code doesn't have critical logs in deployment, and you should notice right away if that were to happen.

### Test run time duration in the log output
The log output includes the test run duration. Here's an example:

`Jul 09 14:54:42.420 INFO Program execution time: 10.06022ms`

## Next steps üéØ
The **Matchstick** framework is currently live for beta testing. There is a lot of room for improvements to everything we've talked about above. We're trying to gather as much feedback from subgraph developers as we can, to understand how we can solve the problems they face when building subgraphs, as well as how we can make the overall testing process as smooth and streamlined as possible.

There's a GitHub project board where we keep track of day to day work which you can check out [here](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/projects/1 "here").

You can check out the full list of tasks [here](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/projects/2).

## Technologies used üíª

![diagram-resized](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32264020/128724602-81699397-1bb9-4e54-94f5-bb0f40c2a38b.jpg)

The **Matchstick** framework is built in **Rust** and acts as a wrapper for the generated WebAssembly module that contains the mappings and the unit tests. It passes the host function implementations down to the module, to be used in the tests (and in the mappings if needed). The framework also acts as a proxy for structs defined in the [graph-node repo](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/tree/master/graph "graph-node repo"), because it needs to pass down all the usual imports, as well as a few bonus/mocked ones glued on top.

**Matchstick** also relies on a helper library - [matchstick-as](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick-as "matchstick-as"), written in **AssemblyScript** and used as an import in the unit tests.
